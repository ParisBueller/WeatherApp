# WeatherApp
A Weather app that shows the current weather in your current location.

This simple weather app was part of the freecodecamp.com curriculum, and was 
built using Javascript and Jquery as well as fcc' weather api providing 
weather data and weather icons. 
The source code is cloneable and you can find a working example here
